# Audio samples

This folder contains various audio files used for testing. You will need `ffmpeg` & `wget` installed and in your `PATH`.
If you want to quickly get some more samples, simply run `download-samples.sh`. This will download several public audio files and convert them to appropriate 16-bit WAV format using `ffmpeg`.
